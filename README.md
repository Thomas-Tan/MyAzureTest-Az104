# MyAzureTest-Az104
 Tan Jun's Script repo for AZ-104 test learning course
# Why raise this repo
 This is a repo that I use to keep all scripts files during my learning course of **[AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/?wt.mc_id=esi_lxp_webpage_wwl)**, because I find those script files were seperated and take time to find and test.

# What included in this Repo
There are two kinds of script file included: PowerShell and Azure CLI.<br>
I find some Azure function call using Az CLI is quite straight forward, while other function call using PowerShell seems much convinence. <br>
The main purpose for using script file is to enhance operator's efficency, so far I include what ever script file I tested here.
